      YaST and yomi provide easy ways to install an operating system 
      onto a computer or other machines. YaST also provides its 
      powerful tooling via a graphical interface to easily configure 
      your system.

    name: Packaging
    description: |
      Thanks to the Open Build Service (OBS), packaging software for 
      most distributions is easy. The review process is aided by the 
      staging process using openQA and Cavil, making it possible to 
      verify that packages which are going into a repository work 
      and are licensed under compatible licenses for a given 
      repository.

  container:
    name: Images and Containers
    description: |
      The Open Build Service (OBS) can be used to not only build 
      packages and appliances but also for building containers and 
      images as well. Building containers with native tools 
      including Docker allows us to quickly and easily build 
      containers within OBS for multiple distributions in a secure 
      and tested manner. Images too can be built within OBS, via 
      KIWI and the repositories within OBS itself.

      openQA is an automated testing tool for operating systems and 
      the engine at the heart of openSUSE's automated testing initiative. 
      The project is used by open-source projects including Fedora, Qubes 
      OS and many others.

    name: Event organization
    description: |
      The Open Source Event Manager assists with communicating the value
      of an event by having a splash page, agenda and more. It allows
      for the submission of proposals for talks, rating and evaluating
      of submissions and the scheduling of events. It also provides
      analytics and allows visitors to register and buy tickets to an event.
      The openSUSE Travel Support Program aims to support contributors
      representing openSUSE to attend events, conferences and hack-fests 
      with their travel and hotel costs. The program pays up to 80% of 
      the travel and/or hotel costs for contributors who could not afford 
      to attend these events otherwise.

      Btrfs is a file system that uses a copy on write (CoW) principle 
      that provides full-copy snapshots of files on a system. The 
      project started in 2007 and is a part of the Linux kernel. It is 
      under active development and jointly developed by multiple companies.

  integration:

    description: |
      openSUSE integrates into Linux via many tools and configuration 
      files including libeconf, libstorage-ng, and libpathrs. Together
      they form the backbone of the tools that developers use for 
      compiling, testing and developing packages on openSUSE and other 
      Linux distributions. 
    software:
      libstorage:
        name: libstorage-ng

    description: | 
      The OSC Collaboration tools can be used to facilitate packaging 
      in openSUSE. Some of the work can now be automated with the osc 
      collab plugin, which makes it much easier for new users to get 
      started in packaging. It also allows you to work on a single 
      package with the same name from multiple projects, where they 
      will be updated simultanously.

about_description: |
  openSUSE is a Free Software project created around the openSUSE Linux 
  distributions and a variety of tools including YaST, the Open Build 
  Service, openQA,Snapper, KIWI, OSEM and many others. We strive to 
  promote an open and friendly community where everyone is welcome, 
  regardless of where they live or work in the world. 
  
  openSUSE is well known for it's Linux distributions. Tumbleweed 
  is a tested, rolling release distribution allowing users to have 
  an up-to-date system that is tested and well supported. For users 
  who need long-term support openSUSE maintains Leap, with releases 
  once a year. MicroOS and Kubic are new self-contained transactional 
  distributions for use on the desktop or in containers.
